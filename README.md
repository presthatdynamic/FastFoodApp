# FastFoodApp
Fast-Food-Fast is a food delivery service app for a restaurant  driven by a Flask(Python) based web application.

## File Structure-

### 1.flask_app.py
This python file is the main app that starts the local host and thus the application itself.
### 2.views.py
This python file contains the code for ruting of the app to different references and also rendering of HTML files.
This also contains the interactions with the database.

The code in views.py could be put in flask_app.py itself.
I have done this split up for a better understanding of different functionalities.

### 2.static
This folder contains all the static files like images and the css stylesheets.
### 3.templates
This directory contains all the HTML files that need to be rendered.
